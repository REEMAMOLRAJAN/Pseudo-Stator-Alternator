# Pseudo-Stator-Alternator
This is a simple generator which utilises Faradeys laws of electromagnetic induction.
Conventional generators have rotor and a stator. The inetraction of these two parts generates electricity. However, in this proposed model there is no stator. We are developing another rotor. 
it is efficient to use for Indian Railways.
